Project Title : Snake game
Most of us have played a very interesting game “Snake” on our old Nokia phones (Black & White).
When the game is started a snake is controlled by up, down, left and right keys to eat food which appears on random locations.
By eating food snake’s length increases one unit and player’s score increases.
The game also has hurdles placed at the random locations. The snake dies if it collides with itself or the hurdle.
the food is also placed in different locations.
While making this project i refer some blogs.
